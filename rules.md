**__Notes:__**  
**Rules**  
The rules can and will change. You can make suggestions at #suggestions or on the [GitHub Repository](<https://github.com/SophiaFoxyCoxy/Europa-Server-Rules>).  
Changes are automatically made and an announcement will be made.  
Breaking most rules will only result in a verbal warning unless repeated. However, some rules are enforced more heavily than others. Breaking them will result in a harsher punishment.  
If you are not sure if your content will break the rules, either don't share it or ask a moderator beforehand.  

**Channels**  
If you are unsure if your content belongs in a channel, read the topic! If you don't know how to read it, ask in #general.  
You can add #suggestions for new channels or changing the topic description if it isn't clear.  

**Users with bot tag (Webhooks)**  
Webhooks are not the same as bots despite looking very similar. Please be mindful of this. @PluralKit and @NQN use webhooks for various reasons.  

**Bot: @PluralKit**  
@PluralKit was added to the server for people who have a plural systems to express themselves.  
 
Discriminatory/Offensive use:  
This bot is not a toy to be played around with and abused. This is not the place for that. Any abuse of the bot will result in an official disciplinary action.  
 
Misuse of this bot can be considered as discrimination, akin to transphobia or sexism.  
You can learn more about [Plurality](<https://pluralityresource.org/plurality-information/>), and [Dissociative Disorders](<https://www.nami.org/About-Mental-Illness/Mental-Health-Conditions/Dissociative-Disorders>) by clicking the respective links.  
 
Adding a system tag (global) or server tag:  
Use the `pk;system tag` or `pk;system servertag` command to permanently append a suffix to the PluralKit webhook username.  
 
Basic tutorial:  
You can reply to a message and use `pk;edit` to edit a message.  
Reacting with a ❌ will delete the message.  
 
You can read the [PluralKit Guide](<https://pluralkit.me/start/>) with the previous link.  

**Bot: @NQN**  
@NQN (Not Quite Nitro) is used to allow people to use external emotes even if they don't have Nitro.  
Please only use NQN commands in #bot-chat or in a DM with the bot.  
 
Basic tutorial:  
Use `!alias` to get started. This will bring up a list of commands.  
To get a list of your current aliases, run `!alias list` or `!alias dm`.  
To search for an alias, use `!alias search` followed by the search term (so `!alias search Amber` for example).  
A menu will pop up with a list of choices. Use the reactions to navigate and select aliases to make.  
 
To use an emote, type it in as you would any emote, making sure to use its full name (`:amberpat:` for example). This is case-sensitive.  
The bot will replace your message with one from a webhook. This means your message will disappear and what appears to be a bot message will replace it.  

**Bot: @ModMail**  
You can use @ModMail to send reports of other users discretely.  
 
To send a report:  
DM the bot with the report and follow it's instructions.  
You will need to verify it and allow it access to your account.  
Multiple servers use this bot, so make sure to select `Europa's Server` from the dialogue. Use reactions to navigate.  
 
Notes:  
All moderators can see and respond but it is hidden to normal users.  
Do not misuse or action will be taken.  
Misuse counts as spamming, reporting false information, editing information before sending, or otherwise being disingenuous with your report.
